# Inspiration
We would like to give users a easier way to access stocks' data according to their preference, and give them financial advice for free.

# Our team
We are four Rice freshman who has huge interests in computer science and data analysis. We are so excited to use this opportunity to gain more experience with coding and building project within 24 hour.

# What it does
Our project will connect to Yahoo's database about stocks, and crawl the stock prices we need. After that, we will edit the data to make it readable for the users. According to these data, we will also give users financial advice about these stocks (sell, buy, or keep) based on an algorithmic strategy we used. We also apply natural language processing to make user-interaction more intuitive. The project itself will be presented in the form of a Facebook messenger bot, which we created by using the library Flask.
How we built it
The language we use is Python. We extensively used the libraries Flask, Numpy, Pandas, and nltk.

# Challenges we ran into
We found it challenging to merge individual tasks into one working projects. However, we properly divide our work into message reading, data analysis, natural language selection and code integration.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have successfully employed several libraries and technology we were not familiar with before. Also, I think we successfully make one huge tasks into separate small problems.

# What we learned
We have learned several new Python packages such as Flask, Numpy, Pandas, and Natural Language Tool Kit.
